# Copilot Instructions for AKS Baseline

This repository is the **reference implementation** for the [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) baseline cluster](https://aka.ms/architecture/aks-baseline) architecture from Azure Architecture Center. It demonstrates the **minimum recommended baseline** for most AKS clusters and serves as the starting point for architectural conversations. Adapt it to your specific requirements before production use.
