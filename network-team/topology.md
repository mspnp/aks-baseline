# AKS baseline network topology

> Note: This is part of the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) baseline cluster reference implementation. For more information see the [readme file in the root](../README.md).

There are multiple network CIDR ranges used throughout this reference implementation.

## Hub virtual network

`CIDR: 10.200.0.0/24`

This regional virtual network hub (shared) holds the following subnets:

- [Azure Firewall subnet]
- [Gateway subnet]
- [Azure Bastion subnet], with reference NSG in place

> For more information about this topology, you can read more at [Azure hub-spoke topology].

## Spoke virtual network

`CIDR: 10.240.0.0/16`

This virtual network holds the following subnets:

- [AKS System Nodepool] and [AKS User Nodepool] subnet
- [AKS Internal Load Balancer subnet]
- [Azure Application Gateway subnet]
- [Private Link Endpoint subnet]
- All with basic NSGs around each

In the future, this virtual network might hold more subnets like [Azure Container Instances Provider instance subnets], more [AKS Nodepools subnets], and more.

This reference implementation uses a /22 subnet for node pools, but in your solution you might be able to use a smaller subnet, depending on the number of nodes that you plan to scale to.

## Pod address space

`CIDR: 192.168.0.0/16`

The cluster uses [Azure CNI Overlay]. Pods within the cluster are assigned IP addresses from within a separate CIDR range to those used by the virtual networks.

Nodes are assigned IP addresses from within the spoke virtual network's subnet, and also are allocated a /24 block within the pod address space for their pods to use.

## Additional considerations

- [AKS System Nodepool] and [AKS User Nodepool] subnet:  multitenant or other advanced workloads may have nodepool isolation requirements that might demand more (and likely smaller) subnets.
- [AKS Internal Load Balancer subnet]: multitenant, multiple SSL termination rules, single PPE supporting dev/QA/UAT, and so on could lead to needing more ingress controllers, but for baseline, we should start with one.
- [Private Endpoints] subnet: Private Links are created for Azure Container Registry and Azure Key Vault, so these Azure services can be accessed using Private Endpoints within the spoke virtual network. There are multiple [Private Link deployment options]; in this implementation they are deployed to a dedicated subnet within the spoke virtual network.
