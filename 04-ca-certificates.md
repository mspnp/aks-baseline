# Generate your Client-Facing and AKS Ingress Controller TLS Certificates

Now that the [hub-spoke network is provisioned](./03-networking.md), you can follow the steps below to create the TLS certificates for each region that Azure Application Gateway will serve for clients connecting to your web app as well as the AKS Ingress Controller. If you already have access to an appropriate certificates, or can procure them from your organization, consider doing so and skipping the certificate generation steps. The following will describe using certs for instructive purposes only.

## Expected results

Following the steps below you will result the certificates needed for Azure Application Gateway and AKS Ingress Controller.

| An AKS ingress Controller Certificate     | It is a self-signed wildcard cert for TLS on the cluster ingress controller.                                                            |

## Steps

1. Generate client-facing TLS certificates for each region

   > :book: The Contoso Bicycle organization has an important policy that every internet-facing endpoint exposed over the Https protocol must use a trusted CA certificate, and it is not allowed to share a common wildcard certificate between them. Therefore, the organization needs to procure individual trusted CA certificates for all their Public Ips FQDN in the different regions. The Azure Application Gateway instances are going to be serving these certificates in front of every region they get deployed to.

   ```bash
   # get the Public IP FQDNs, their subdomins, and resource ids
   APPGW_FQDN_BU0001A0042_03=$(az deployment group show -g rg-enterprise-networking-spokes -n spoke-BU0001A0042-03 --query properties.outputs.appGwFqdn.value -o tsv)
   APPGW_FQDN_BU0001A0042_04=$(az deployment group show -g rg-enterprise-networking-spokes -n spoke-BU0001A0042-04 --query properties.outputs.appGwFqdn.value -o tsv)
   APPGW_SUBDOMAIN_BU0001A0042_03=$(az deployment group show -g rg-enterprise-networking-spokes -n spoke-BU0001A0042-03 --query properties.outputs.subdomainName.value -o tsv)
   APPGW_SUBDOMAIN_BU0001A0042_04=$(az deployment group show -g rg-enterprise-networking-spokes -n spoke-BU0001A0042-04 --query properties.outputs.subdomainName.value -o tsv)
   APPGW_IP_RESOURCE_ID_03=$(az deployment group show -g rg-enterprise-networking-spokes -n spoke-BU0001A0042-03 --query properties.outputs.appGatewayPublicIp.value -o tsv)
   APPGW_IP_RESOURCE_ID_04=$(az deployment group show -g rg-enterprise-networking-spokes -n spoke-BU0001A0042-04 --query properties.outputs.appGatewayPublicIp.value -o tsv)

   # call the Let's Encrypt certificate generation script for both PIP FQDNs
   # [Generate the following certificates takes about ten minutes to run.]
   sudo chmod +x ./certs/letsencrypt-pip-cert-generation.sh
   sudo chmod +x ./certs/autogenerator.sh
   ./certs/letsencrypt-pip-cert-generation.sh $APPGW_SUBDOMAIN_BU0001A0042_03 $APPGW_FQDN_BU0001A0042_03 $APPGW_IP_RESOURCE_ID_03 eastus2
   ./certs/letsencrypt-pip-cert-generation.sh $APPGW_SUBDOMAIN_BU0001A0042_04 $APPGW_FQDN_BU0001A0042_04 $APPGW_IP_RESOURCE_ID_04 centralus
   ```

   :bulb: EV certificates are mostly recommended for user-facing endpoints, which is not the case in this multi region reference implementation. The Azure Application Gateways instances are going to be just the regional backend servers for a globally distributed load balancer. For more information on how these certificates are being generated, please refer to [Certificate Generation for an Azure Public IP with your DNS Prefix](https://github.com/mspnp/letsencrypt-pip-cert-generation).

1. Base64 encode the client-facing certificate

   :bulb: No matter if you used a certificate from your organization or you generated one from above, you'll need the certificate (as `.pfx`) to be base 64 encoded for proper storage in Key Vault later.

   ```bash
   APP_GATEWAY_LISTENER_REGION1_CERTIFICATE_BASE64=$(cat ${APPGW_SUBDOMAIN_BU0001A0042_03}.pfx | base64 | tr -d '\n')
   APP_GATEWAY_LISTENER_REGION2_CERTIFICATE_BASE64=$(cat ${APPGW_SUBDOMAIN_BU0001A0042_04}.pfx | base64 | tr -d '\n')
   ```

1. Generate the wildcard certificate for the AKS Ingress Controller

   > :book: Contoso Bicycle will also procure another TLS certificate, a standard cert, to be used with the AKS Ingress Controller. This one is not EV, as it will not be user facing. Finally the app team decides to use a wildcard certificate of `*.aks-ingress.contoso.com` for the ingress controller. As this is not an internet-facing endpoint; using a wildcard certificate is a valid option.

   ```bash
   openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -out traefik-ingress-internal-aks-ingress-contoso-com-tls.crt -keyout traefik-ingress-internal-aks-ingress-contoso-com-tls.key -subj "/CN=*.aks-ingress.contoso.com/O=Contoso Aks Ingress"

   # Combined as PEM structure (required by Azure Application Gateway for backend pools)
   cat traefik-ingress-internal-aks-ingress-contoso-com-tls.crt traefik-ingress-internal-aks-ingress-contoso-com-tls.key > traefik-ingress-internal-aks-ingress-contoso-com-tls.pem
   ```

1. Base64 encode the AKS Ingress Controller certificate

   :bulb: No matter if you used a certificate from your organization or you generated one from above, you'll need the public certificate (as `.crt` or `.cer`) to be base 64 encoded for proper storage in Key Vault later.

   ```bash
   AKS_INGRESS_CONTROLLER_CERTIFICATE_BASE64=$(cat traefik-ingress-internal-aks-ingress-contoso-com-tls.crt | base64 | tr -d '\n')
   ```
