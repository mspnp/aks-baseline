# This workflow will deploy our bootstrapped cluster stamp, without the workload.
#
# Follow the next steps to use this workflow:
#
# 1. Your repository has the following structure.
#    .
#    ├── .github
#    │   ├── workflows
#    │   │   └── aks-deploy.yaml
#    ├── cluster-manifests
#    │   ├── cluster-baseline-settings/*
#    └── cluster-stamp.json
#
# 2. Ensure you have followed the prior sections before deploying this AKS cluster. This way, you will be capable of setting:
#    - the secrets values as detailed in the next step.
#    - the environment variables from the env dictionary at the worklflow level.
#
# 3. Create the following secrets in your GitHub repository:
#    - AZURE_CREDENTIALS                         The Azure Service Principal that will deploy the AKS cluster in your Azure subscription. For more information please take a look at https://github.com/Azure/login#configure-deployment-credentials
#    - APP_GATEWAY_LISTENER_CERTIFICATE_BASE64   The certificate data for app gateway TLS termination. It is base64. Ideally fetch this secret from a platform-managed secret store such as Azure KeyVault: https://github.com/marketplace/actions/azure-key-vault-get-secrets
#    - AKS_INGRESS_CONTROLLER_CERTIFICATE_BASE64 The Base64 encoded AKS Ingress Controller public certificate (as .crt or .cer) to be stored in Azure Key Vault as secret and referenced by Azure Application Gateway as a trusted root certificate.
