# Workload Prerequisites

The AKS Cluster has been enrolled in [GitOps management](./07-gitops.md), wrapping up the infrastructure focus of the [AKS secure Baseline reference implementation](./). Follow the steps below to import the TLS certificate that the Ingress Controller will serve for Application Gateway to connect to your web app.

## Steps

## Import the wildcard certificate for the AKS Ingress Controller to Azure Key Vault

> :book: Contoso Bicycle procured a CA certificate, a standard one, to be used with the AKS Ingress Controller. This one is not EV, as it will not be user facing.

1. Obtain the Azure Key Vault details and give the current user permissions to import certificates.

   > :book: Finally the app team decides to use a wildcard certificate of `*.aks-ingress.contoso.com` for the ingress controller. They use Azure Key Vault to import and manage the lifecycle of this certificate.

   ```bash
   KEYVAULT_NAME_BU0001A0042_03=$(az deployment group show --resource-group rg-bu0001a0042-03 -n cluster-stamp --query properties.outputs.keyVaultName.value -o tsv)
   KEYVAULT_NAME_BU0001A0042_04=$(az deployment group show --resource-group rg-bu0001a0042-04 -n cluster-stamp --query properties.outputs.keyVaultName.value -o tsv)
   az keyvault set-policy --certificate-permissions import list get --upn $(az account show --query user.name -o tsv) -n $KEYVAULT_NAME_BU0001A0042_03
   az keyvault set-policy --certificate-permissions import list get --upn $(az account show --query user.name -o tsv) -n $KEYVAULT_NAME_BU0001A0042_04
   ```

1. Import the AKS Ingress Controller's Wildcard Certificate for `*.aks-ingress.contoso.com`.

   :warning: If you already have access to an appropriate certificate, or can procure one from your organization, consider using it for this step. For more information, please take a look at the [import certificate tutorial using Azure Key Vault](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/certificates/tutorial-import-certificate#import-a-certificate-to-key-vault).

   :warning: Do not use the certificate created by this script for actual deployments. The use of self-signed certificates are provided for ease of illustration purposes only. For your cluster, use your organization's requirements for procurement and lifetime management of TLS certificates, _even for development purposes_.

   ```bash
   cat traefik-ingress-internal-aks-ingress-contoso-com-tls.crt traefik-ingress-internal-aks-ingress-contoso-com-tls.key > traefik-ingress-internal-aks-ingress-contoso-com-tls.pem
   az keyvault certificate import -f traefik-ingress-internal-aks-ingress-contoso-com-tls.pem -n traefik-ingress-internal-aks-ingress-contoso-com-tls --vault-name $KEYVAULT_NAME_BU0001A0042_03
   az keyvault certificate import -f traefik-ingress-internal-aks-ingress-contoso-com-tls.pem -n traefik-ingress-internal-aks-ingress-contoso-com-tls --vault-name $KEYVAULT_NAME_BU0001A0042_04
   ```

1. Remove Azure Key Vault import certificates permissions for current user.

   > The Azure Key Vault Policy for your user was a temporary policy to allow you to upload the certificate for this walkthrough. In actual deployments, you would manage these access policies via your ARM templates using [Azure RBAC for Key Vault data plane](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/general/secure-your-key-vault#data-plane-and-access-policies).

   ```bash
   az keyvault delete-policy --upn $(az account show --query user.name -o tsv) -n $KEYVAULT_NAME_BU0001A0042_03
   az keyvault delete-policy --upn $(az account show --query user.name -o tsv) -n $KEYVAULT_NAME_BU0001A0042_04
   ```

## Check Azure Policies are in place

> :book: The app team wants to apply Azure Policy over their cluster like they do other Azure resources. Their pods will be covered using the [Azure Policy add-on for AKS](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/aks/use-pod-security-on-azure-policy). Some of these audits might end up in the denial of a specific Kubernetes API request operation to ensure the pod's specification is compliance with the organization's security best practices. Moreover [data is generated by Azure Policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/governance/policy/how-to/get-compliance-data) to assist the app team in the process of assessing the current compliance state of the AKS cluster. The app team is going to assign at the resource group level the [Azure Policy for Kubernetes built-in restricted initiative](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/aks/use-pod-security-on-azure-policy#built-in-policy-initiatives) as well as five more [built-in individual Azure policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/aks/policy-samples#microsoftcontainerservice) that enforce that pods perform resource requests, define trusted container registries, mandate that root filesystem access is read-only, enforce the usage of internal load balancers, and enforce https-only Kubernetes Ingress objects.

1. Get the cluster names for regions 1 and 2.

   ```bash
   AKS_CLUSTER_NAME_BU0001A0042_03=$(az deployment group show -g rg-bu0001a0042-03 -n cluster-stamp --query properties.outputs.aksClusterName.value -o tsv)
   AKS_CLUSTER_NAME_BU0001A0042_04=$(az deployment group show -g rg-bu0001a0042-04 -n cluster-stamp --query properties.outputs.aksClusterName.value -o tsv)
   ```

1. Get AKS `kubectl` credentials.

   > In the [Azure Active Directory Integration](03-aad.md) step, we placed our cluster under AAD group-backed RBAC. This is the first time we are seeing this used. `az aks get-credentials` allows you to use `kubectl` commands against your cluster. Without the AAD integration, you'd have to use `--admin` here, which isn't what we want to happen. In a following step, you'll log in with a user that has been added to the Azure AD security group used to back the Kubernetes RBAC admin role. Executing the first `kubectl` command below will invoke the AAD login process to auth the _user of your choice_, which will then be checked against Kubernetes RBAC to perform the action. The user you choose to log in with _must be a member of the AAD group bound_ to the `cluster-admin` ClusterRole. For simplicity you could either use the "break-glass" admin user created in [Azure Active Directory Integration](03-aad.md) (`bu0001a0042-admin`) or any user you assigned to the `cluster-admin` group assignment in your [`cluster-rbac.yaml`](cluster-manifests/cluster-rbac.yaml) file. If you skipped those steps you can use `--admin` to proceed, but proper AAD group-based RBAC access is a critical security function that you should invest time in setting up.

   ```bash
   az aks get-credentials -g rg-bu0001a0042-03 -n $AKS_CLUSTER_NAME_BU0001A0042_03
   az aks get-credentials -g rg-bu0001a0042-04 -n $AKS_CLUSTER_NAME_BU0001A0042_04
   ```

   :warning: At this point two important steps are happening:

   - The `az aks get-credentials` command will be fetch a `kubeconfig` containing references to the AKS cluster you have created earlier.
   - To _actually_ use the cluster you will need to authenticate. For that, run any `kubectl` commands which at this stage will prompt you to authenticate against Azure Active Directory. For example, run the following command:

   ```bash
   kubectl get nodes --context $AKS_CLUSTER_NAME_BU0001A0042_03
   ```

   Once the authentication happens successfully, some new items will be added to your `kubeconfig` file such as an `access-token` with an expiration period. For more information on how this process works in Kubernetes please refer to [the related documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#openid-connect-tokens).

1. Confirm policies are applied to the AKS cluster

   ```bash
   kubectl get constrainttemplate --context $AKS_CLUSTER_NAME_BU0001A0042_03
   kubectl get constrainttemplate --context $AKS_CLUSTER_NAME_BU0001A0042_04
   ```

   A similar output as the one showed below should be returned

   ```output
   NAME                                     AGE
   k8sazureallowedcapabilities              21m
   k8sazureallowedseccomp                   21m
   … more …
   k8sazurereadonlyrootfilesystem           21m
   k8sazurevolumetypes                      21m
   ```
